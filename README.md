# Personal Website ðŸŒƒâœ¨

### What your project is/does
\-\-\> Basic personal website, started with GWC web dev course and added on additional features
### Why I made it
--> Have a basic website I can expand on in the future and have expanded on
### How I made it
--> GWC tutorial and then w3schools. Did drawing of parallax in pixlr.com
### Struggles and Learning
--> Struggle: I was trying to make it a different format so the main content is narrower than the computer screen but gave up. Learned more css and found it's similar to SwiftUI, Struggled with github pages the css not showing up because the path did not work for pages, and the whole thing crashing because they rejected my application for Github Education in the middle when I was deploying
### Future Changes and Improvements
--> Add project links and real projects, add work experience page ðŸ’€, add a light mode button, just add cooler features in general
