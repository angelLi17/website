# Personal Website ğŸŒƒâœ¨

### What your project is/does
\-\-\> Basic personal website, started with GWC web dev course and added on additional features
### Why I made it
--> Have a basic website I can expand on in the future and have expanded on
### How I made it
--> GWC tutorial and then w3schools. Did drawing of parallax in pixlr.com
### Struggles and Learning
--> Struggle: I was trying to make it a different format so the main content is narrower than the computer screen but gave up. Learned more css and found it's similar to SwiftUI
### Future Changes and Improvements
--> Add project links and real projects, add work experience page ğŸ’€, add a light mode button, just add cooler features in general
