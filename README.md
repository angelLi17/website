# Personal Website ðŸŒƒâœ¨

### What your project is/does (and what it's called)
\-\-\> Extremely basic personal website, part of GWC web dev course
### Why you made your project
--> Have a basic website I can expand on in the future
### How you made your project
--> GWC tutorial + w3schools
### What you struggled with and what you learned
--> I was trying to make it a different format so the main content is narrower than the computer screen but gave up. Learned more css and found it's similar to SwiftUI
